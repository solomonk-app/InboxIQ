<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">InboxIQ</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how InboxIQ ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application and related services.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture from your Google account. This information is used to create and manage your InboxIQ account.</p>

<p><strong>Email Data:</strong> We request read-only access to your Gmail inbox to analyze and categorize your emails. We access email metadata (sender, subject, date) and email content solely for the purpose of generating AI-powered digests and summaries.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We track basic usage metrics such as the number of digests generated per day to manage service limits and improve the app experience.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To authenticate your identity via Google OAuth</li>
  <li>To read and analyze your emails for generating AI-powered digests</li>
  <li>To categorize your emails and extract action items</li>
  <li>To deliver scheduled digest summaries</li>
  <li>To manage your subscription and account preferences</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Email Data Handling</h2>

<p><strong>Read-Only Access:</strong> We only request read-only access to your Gmail. We never send, delete, or modify your emails.</p>

<p><strong>No Full Storage:</strong> Your emails are never stored in full on our servers. Email content is processed in real-time by our AI service (Google Gemini) to generate summaries and is not retained after processing.</p>

<p><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Email content is sent to Google's Gemini AI service for analysis and summarization. This processing is subject to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms">Google's Gemini API Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<p>Your account information and preferences are stored securely using Supabase, a cloud database platform with encryption at rest and in transit. Authentication tokens are stored on your device using platform-secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore).</p>

<p>Google OAuth tokens (access and refresh tokens) are stored securely on our server to maintain your Gmail connection. These tokens can be revoked at any time through your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account permissions</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google OAuth:</strong> For authentication and Gmail access</li>
  <li><strong>Google Gemini AI:</strong> For email analysis and digest generation</li>
  <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For secure data storage</li>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management and payment processing</li>
  <li><strong>Render:</strong> For backend hosting</li>
  <li><strong>Expo / EAS:</strong> For app distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these services has their own privacy policies governing their handling of your data.</p>

<h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

<p>Subscription payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. Subscription status is managed through RevenueCat. Please refer to your platform's payment terms for details.</p>

<h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We do not share your email content with anyone except as necessary for AI processing (Google Gemini) to provide the core service functionality.</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active. Digest summaries are retained for your convenience but can be deleted at any time. If you delete your account, all associated data will be removed from our servers within 30 days.</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Revoke access:</strong> Disconnect InboxIQ from your Google account at any time via <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account permissions</a></li>
  <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> Contact us to request complete deletion of your data</li>
  <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
  <li><strong>Opt out:</strong> Uninstall the app and revoke Google access to stop all data processing</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>InboxIQ is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy in the app or on our website. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
